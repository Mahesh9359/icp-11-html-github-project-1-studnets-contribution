        <li>The human circulatory system is a complex network responsible for the transportation of blood, nutrients, oxygen, and waste products throughout the body.</li>
        <li>At its core, the heart pumps oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body via arteries and returns deoxygenated blood back to the lungs through veins.</li>
        <li>This vital system ensures that every cell receives the necessary substances to function effectively while removing metabolic wastes.</li>
        <li>The intricate arrangement of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries, plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's homeostasis and overall health.</li>

            <td><b>Red blood cells (RBC) / Erythrocytes</b></td>
            <td>Red Blood Cells (RBCs), also known as erythrocytes, are crucial components of our blood. They are primarily responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returning carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. RBCs achieve this through hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen.

                Interestingly, RBCs have a unique biconcave shape, which increases their surface area and facilitates efficient gas exchange. Unlike other cells, mature RBCs lack a nucleus, which allows more space for hemoglobin but also means they can't repair themselves. As a result, RBCs have a lifespan of about 120 days, after which they are broken down and recycled by the spleen and liver.</td>

            <td><b>White blood cells (WBC) / Leukocytes</b></td>
            <td>White Blood Cells (WBCs), or leukocytes, are a crucial part of the immune system. Unlike Red Blood Cells, WBCs are responsible for defending the body against infections and foreign invaders.WBCs are produced in the bone marrow and circulate in the blood and lymphatic system. Unlike RBCs, WBCs have nuclei, and their lifespan varies widely, from a few hours to several days. Maintaining a healthy WBC count is essential for a robust immune system. Low WBC counts (leukopenia) can indicate vulnerability to infections, while high counts (leukocytosis) can signal inflammation, infection, or other medical conditions.</td>

            <td>Platelets are cells that help to form clots and stop bleeding. They act on the site of an injury or a wound.Platelets, or thrombocytes, are small, colorless cell fragments in the blood that are essential for blood clotting and wound healing. When a blood vessel is injured, platelets quickly gather at the site of the injury, stick to the vessel's lining, and form a temporary "plug" to help stop bleeding. This process is known as coagulation.</td>
